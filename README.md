# **Project Proposal**

## **1. The Big Idea**
The project focuses on developing a Python-based web application that tracks the performance of a portfolio consisting of stocks, cryptocurrencies, and commodities. Users can input details like asset type, symbol, purchase date, and investment amount. The application retrieves historical and current prices using APIs, calculates individual asset performance, and aggregates the overall portfolio value.

- **MVP:** A Flask-based application where users input multiple assets and receive portfolio performance metrics (current value, absolute change, and percentage change).
- **Stretch Goal:** Add features such as:
  - Interactive data visualizations with `Matplotlib` or `Plotly`.
  - Currency conversion using an external API (e.g., OpenExchangeRates).

---

## **2. Learning Objectives**
- **Shared Goals:** Develop skills in Python web frameworks, API integration, and effective team collaboration.
Build robust backend logic for API integrations, data processing, and portfolio calculations using Flask.
Design and implement a responsive user interface using Flask templates or React and integrate visualizations.

---

## **3. Implementation Plan**
1. **API Integration:**
   - Use APIs such as Alpha Vantage (stocks), CoinGecko (crypto), and Gold API (commodities) to fetch pricing data.
2. **Backend Development:**
   - Create Flask endpoints to handle user input and process API data.
   - Implement logic for portfolio calculations (e.g., total value and performance metrics).
3. **Frontend Development:**
   - Design input forms for users to add and remove assets.
   - Display results dynamically using responsive HTML and integrate visualizations with libraries like `Plotly`.
4. **Testing and Deployment:**
   - Use mock data to test both backend and frontend functionality.
---

## **4. Project Schedule**
1. **Week 1:** Research APIs, finalize the app architecture, and create a basic backend prototype.
2. **Week 2:** Backend developer completes API integration and implements portfolio calculation logic. Frontend developer begins designing the input forms and basic UI layout.
3. **Week 3:** Backend developer refines Flask endpoints and ensures smooth API communication. Frontend developer connects the UI to backend endpoints and tests data display.
4. **Week 4:** Add stretch features like visualizations and ensure a responsive user experience.

---

## **5. Collaboration Plan**
- **Role Division:** 
  - Backend Developer: Focuses on Flask development, API integrations, and calculations.
  - Frontend Developer: Builds a dynamic, user-friendly interface and integrates it with the backend.
- **Version Control:** Use GitHub for collaborative coding with frequent commits and pull requests.
- **Communication Tools:** Use Whatsapp updates 

---

## **6. Risks and Limitations**
- **Integration Challenges:** Ensuring smooth communication between the backend and frontend might require additional time for debugging.
- **Scope Creep:** Adding too many features could complicate the project beyond the need

---

## **7. Additional Course Content**
- Visualization libraries like `Plotly` or `Dash` for dynamic, interactive graphs.
